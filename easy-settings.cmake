# Define our top level settings.  Whilst they have doc strings for readability
# here, they are hidden in the cmake-gui as they cannot be reliably changed

# they know what they are doing through advanced mode.

# Users should initialize a build directory by doing something like:
#
# mkdir build_sabre
# cd build_sabre
#
# Then
#
# ../griddle --PLATFORM=sabre --SIMULATION
